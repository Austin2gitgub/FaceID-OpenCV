# FaceID-OpenCV
OpenCV CNN Face Recognition App

A real-time face verification system built using a **Siamese Neural Network**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow/Keras**. This app compares a live camera feed, runs the trained model — suitable for eKYC, mobile face authentication, and secure access control.
